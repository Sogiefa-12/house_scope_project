[house_scope_project] - Data Analysis Application
=========================================
## Overview
This Python-based application utilizes data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to extract valuable insights from datasets. The application performs various data manipulation, analysis, and visualization tasks, including data cleaning, preprocessing, generating descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and visualizing data using different charts and graphs.
# Features
* Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handles missing data, outliers, and inconsistent data formats to ensure data quality.
* Descriptive statistics: Provides summary statistics, such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, for both categorical and numerical data.
* Data visualization: Generates visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and histograms to help users better understand the data.
* Hypothesis testing: Performs hypothesis tests (e.g., t-test and chi-square tests) to assess the statistical significance of observed differences or relationships between variables.

##  Getting Started
# Installation
* Install Python 3.8 or higher on your system.
